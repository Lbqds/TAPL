### Current
* untyped arithmetic expression
* untyped lambda-calculus
  * boolean, numeric and pair extension, no list and record, but it is easy to do these

### Next
* simply typed lambda-calculus(with type inference)

### TODO
* parser: [fastparse](https://github.com/lihaoyi/fastparse) is a good choice
